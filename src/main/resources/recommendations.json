Here are a few breeds to consider:\n\n1. **Poodle**: Standard, Miniature, and Toy Poodles are highly intelligent and trainable, making them excellent family pets. They have a low-shedding coat that can be suitable for allergy sufferers.\n\n2. **Labradoodle**: A cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle, Labradoodles are friendly and energetic. They often inherit the Poodle’s hypoallergenic coat, but it’s important to choose one from a reputable breeder to increase the likelihood of hypoallergenic traits.\n\n3. **Bichon Frise**: Known for their cheerful and playful nature, Bichon Frises are great with children. They have a curly coat that doesn’t shed much, making them a good option for those with allergies.\n\n4. **Portuguese Water Dog**: This breed is known for being loyal and good with families.
